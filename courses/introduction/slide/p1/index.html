# Scientific Methods in Psychology

The scientific method was first proposed by Sir Francis Bacon (1561-1626) to provide logical, rational problem solving across many scientific fields.

--

The basic steps of the scientific method: 
  - make an observation that describes a research problem, 
  - create a hypothesis, 
  - test the hypothesis, 
  - draw conclusions and refine the hypothesis.
  
--

The aim of the scientific method are 
  - verifiability, 
  - predictability, 
  - falsifiability, 
  - fairness.

--

The application of the scientific theory to psychology took the discipline from a form of philosophy to a form of science.
Critical thinking is a key component of the scientific method. Without it, you cannot use logic to come to conclusions.

# Social sciences vs. natural sciences

Psychology as a science concerned with the social behavior of individuals and groups that are often considered more subjective due to the subject of study.

--

Scientific method: A method of discovering knowledge about the natural world based on making falsifiable predictions (hypotheses), testing them empirically, and developing peer-reviewed theories that best explain the known data.

--

Natural science: Sciences concerned with predicting and describing natural phenomena (e.g., biology, physics, or chemistry), using systematic data collection and performing controlled experiments.
---

# Steps in scientific study?

- Hypothesis

--

- Method

--

- Results

--

- Interpretation

---

# Hypothesis

![](pic/fig21.png)


---
# Evaluating scientific theory

[1] ""
- Falsifiable (theory state at position as clear, precise terms that we can see what evidence would count against it)

--

- Parsimony


---
# General Research Principles (some of them)

Operational Definitions
[1] ""
  - A definition that specifies the operations (or procedures) used to produce or measure something, ordinarily a way to give it a numerical value

--

  - That definition must fit clear sentences that include procedure to measure subject of measurement

--

Population samples

  - convenience sample
  
--

  - representative sample
  
--

  - random sample

---

![](pic/tab21.png)

---
# Observational research design

- Naturalistic observations (is careful examination of what happens under more or less natural conditions)

--

- Case histories (a thorough description of someone, including abilities and disabilities, medical condition, life history, unusual experiences, and whatever else seems relevant)

--

- Surveys (a study of the prevalence of certain beliefs, attitudes, or behaviors based on people's responses to questions)

  - Sampling
  
--

  - The seriousness of those being interviewed
  
--

  - the wording of the qestions
  
--

  - surveyor biases

--

- Correlation studies

  - the correlation coefficient
  
--

  - illusory correlations
  
-- 

  - Correlation is not Causation
  
---
# Experiments

A study in which the investigator manipulates at least one variable while measuring at least one other variable.

--

- Different type of variables

  - independent variable

--

  - dependent variable
  
--

- Different type of group

--

  - Control group
  
--

  - Experimental group
  
--

- Experimenter bias and blind studies

--

  - blind observer

--

  - single blind study
  
--

  - double blind study
  
--

  - different experimental design (e. g. before-after study)
  
  
---
# Evaluating the Results

- Descriptive statistics

--

- Inferential statistics

--

- Replicability issues
  
  
---

# Ok, that's it... for the first part 

--

# Now we have some kind of exam... for 5-10 minutes

--

# Let's go out! 10 minutes according to epidemiological suggestions

---
# Biological Psychology

Almost any statement about the nervous system has exceptions!

---
# Neurons and Behavior

Neurons consists of three parts:

- a cell body

--

- dendrites

--

- axon

--

and... 

--

- glia cells - support the neurons in synchronizing activity among neighboring neurons, removing waste products

---
## Neurons vary enormously in size and shape

![](pic/fig32.jpg)

---
## Estimated distribution of neurons in aduld human CNS

![](pic/fig31.png)
---
## The Action Potential

The Action potential is the main function of the neuron to convey information over long distance e.g. from skin to the primary sensor area in the brain...

--

Phenomenon 1: 'All or none' law: all axons throughout the nervous system produce action potentials of equal strenght

--

Phenomenon 2: An excitation that travels along an axon at a constant strength... no matter how far it travels

--

![](pic/fig33.png)
---
## Signaling

Two important concepts: resting potential and threshold

--

Resting potential: -70mV

--

Threshold: -55mV.... starting influx of sodium ion...

---

![](pic/fig34.png)
---

![](pic/fig35.png)
---
## Neurons communicate chemically

![](pic/fig37.png)
---
## Neural communication takes only 1 - 2 seconds

![](pic/fig38.png)
---
## Important neurotransmitters

![](pic/table31.png)
---
# Drugs and Their Effects

Psychoactive drugs affect synapses trough mechanisms:

--

- agonist: drug that increase activity at synapses

--

- antagonist: drug that decrease activity at synapses

--

- produce altered states of consciousness

--

- receptors ... reuptake phenomenon

---
## Stimulants

Drugs that increase energy, alertness and activity

--

- amphetamine, methaphetamine and cocaine: block the protein that the presynaptic neuron uses to reabsorb dopamine or serotonin after release them

--

- tobacoo, nicotine: affect acetylcholine

--

- increases arousal, higher hart rate, higher blood pressure

---
## Hallucinogens

Drugs that induce sensory distortions that are called hallucinogens or psychedelic.

--

- LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide): attaches mainly one kind of serotonin

--

- MDMA (methylededioxymethamphetamine): increase body temperature, change reality

---
## Depressants

The drugs that decrease arousal, such as alcohol and anxiolytics.

--

- Alcohol

--

- Anxiolytic drugs or tranquilizers (benzodiazepines, diazepam, alprazolam like Xanax)

--

- GHB (gamma hudroxybutyrate)


---
## Drugs and their effects

![](pic/fig312.png)

---

![](pic/tab32b.png)

---
# Brain and Behavior

Monism - the idea that mental activiry and brain activity are inseparable.

--

![](pic/fig313.png)

---
## The Cerebral Cortex

The vertebrate brain has three major divisions: hindbrain, midbrain and forebrain.

--

![](pic/fig315.png)
---

## A view of the forebrain

The important part and functions of temporal lobe (amigdala)

--

![](pic/fig316.png)

---
## The parietal lobe of the cortex


![](pic/fig318.png)
---
## The two hemispheres

![](pic/fig320.png)

---
## The Autonomic Nervous System

![](pic/fig326.png)
---

![](pic/fig327.png)

---
## Measuring brain activity

- EEG 

--

- fMRI - functional magnetic resonance

--

- PET - positron emission tomography

---
## PET scan

![](pic/fig323.png)

---
## fMRI

![](pic/fig324.png)


---
# Genetics and Evolutionary Psychology

Humans has tens of thousands of genes that control development.

--

- Genetics - dominant and recessive

--

- Behavioral genetics

--

- Epigenetics

---

![](pic/fig329.png)

---

![](pic/fig333.png)

---
## Estimated heritability

- twin studies / brothers and sisters

--

- studies of adopted children

---


- Population in statistics describe as totality or all subjects / entities which reference is to be made

--

- Population reference to all subjects / entities with same one or several atributes

--

- A population statistics has no error!

--

- Sample is finite number of subjects / entities from population

--

- Sample is subset of population and statistics in 99% of research deal with them. Not with population!

--

- When we deal with sample that means all statistics have error. We estimate population parameters.

--

- Sampling is main step in the research design. We could not change that in next steps.... statistical analysis could!

---
# Uncertainty and error

- Errors and uncertainty are exists in any research

--

- Statistical procedure estimate the amount of errors and/or uncertainty

--

- Statistical knowledge expressed as probability

--

- Probability is main term / concept of statistical explanation

---
# Degrees

Degrees of research associate with statistical complexity;

1. Descriptive level

--

2. Interpretative level

--

3. Prediction level

---
# Statistical inference

- Explaratory data analysis or descriptive statistics

--

- Statistical inference or inferential statistics

---
# Definitions

Two main parts of statistics
[1] ""
- Descriptive statistics are procedures used to summarize and describe the important characteristics of a set of measurements.

--

- Inferential statistics are procedures used to make inferences (that is, draw conclusions, make predictions, make decisions) about a population from information contained in a sample drawn from this population.


---
# Close connection with research methods

- estimation and hypothesis testing

--

- research design

--

- correlation research vs. experiments

--

- quantitative analysis

--

- but! not only... qualitative analysis needs some calculation and software

---
# Variables

Simple point out about some kind of variables:[@dancey_2020]

- Continuous variables can take on absolutely any value within a given range. 

--

- Discrete variables can only take on certain discrete values in a range. 

--

- Categorical variables are those in which we simply allocate people to categories.
