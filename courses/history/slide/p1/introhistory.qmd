## History of Psychology

::: incremental
The story of psychology begins in ancient times.

-   As a self-conscious formal discipline, psychology is little more than a century old

-   But the subject matter captured the human imagination long before psychology became a science.
:::

-   Descartes' skull, of Dr. "Monsterwork" and his lying machine

-   John B. Watson's measurement of the female orgasm (the real reason he was fired from Johns Hopkins University).

:::

## Why History of Psychology?

::: incremental
-   History as a Key to understanding the **Future**

-   History offers patterns that, when properly viewed, may prove consequential to our understanding and possible control of the present and the future.

-   Psychologists who appreciate their history may be in a better position to understand the discipline while anticipating future trends.)
:::

## Why History of Psychology?

::: incremental
-   history as a Way to Enrich the **Present**

-   We live in a world of spatial, cultural, and temporal dimensions! That is present time...

-   Unfortunately, we can be just as narrow with respect to our time frame as we are with our knowledge of the physical world and other cultures.

-   Imagine how it would restrict your view of yourself if you only had memories about the last few years of your life.
:::

## Why History of Psychology?

::: incremental
-   History as a Contribution to **Liberal Education**

-   Particularly given the increasing specialization in psychology, history can serve to provide context and a broader perspective within psychology (Benjamin & Baker, 2009).

-   Knowledge of the history of a discipline accentuates the understanding of influences, developments, and relations and contributes to a more informed and integrated perspective.
:::

## Why History of Psychology?

::: incremental
-   History teaches **humility**

-   A perspective from past knowledge is larger and more informed than perspectives from the present alone.

-   History all too often reveals that our innovative idea is a rediscovery of something known long ago.
:::

## Why History of Psychology?

::: incremental
-   History teaches a healthy **Skepticism**

-   When we have an understanding of history, we are less likely to fall prey to grandiose notions, utopian dreams, and schemes that promise more than they deliver.

-   Psychology has suffered its share of counterfeit ideas, including mesmerism, phrenology, craniometry (the measurement of the skull to determine intelligence and personality), and even some modern therapies.
:::

## Why History of Psychology?

::: incremental
-   History influences human **thought processes**

-   Henle (1976) pointed out that most of us find it difficult to see our errors or question our assumptions.

-   She argued that human cognition is often resistant to criticism and prone to a degree of **inertia** or **self preservation**.

-   For her, knowledge of history "gives us distance not only from our immediate objective, but from our own thinking"
:::

## Problems in historiography?

::: incremental
-   What makes history?

-   Can history be objective?

-   Historiography has multiple meanings: it refers to the writing of history, including techniques and strategies for investigating specific content areas.

-   The term also encompasses philosophical questions about history and historical method
:::

## Historical consciousness

::: incremental
-   Gilderhus (1992) suggests that primitive peoples often lacked historical consciousness because immediate survival was their primary concern.

-   Survival depends on memory along with an awareness of time-based events. This temporal awareness has survival value and contributes to the development of historical consciousness.

-   Knowledge of the historical significance of events benefits both individuals and society.

-   Historical consciousness grows from the belief that important events carry real significance in the pursuit of religion, politics, or science (Jesus Christ, Holocaust, 9/11 twins...)
:::

## Critical issues in historical studies (King, Viney, Woody, 2016)

::: incremental
-   Why study history?

-   History as a Key to Understanding the Future

-   History as a Way to Enrich the Present

-   History as a Contribution to Liberal Education

-   History Teaches Humility

-   History Teaches a Healthy Skepticism

-   History Influences Human Thought Processes
:::

## Some problems in historiography

::: incremental
-   The Development of Historical Consciousness

-   What Is History?

-   Can History Be Objective?

-   The Tyranny of the Present

-   Is There a Pattern or Direction in History?

-   What Makes History?

-   The New History or the Old?

-   What Is the History of Psychology, the History Of?
:::

## Can history be objective?

::: incremental
-   People have a kind of commonsense faith that historical research whether it deals with religious, political, scientific, or social topics is an **accurate reflection** of the landscape of the past.

-   Historians do not usually make direct observations.

-   The question of objectivity is a critical issue in the philosophy of history.

-   Meaning of objectivity involves the attempt to portray all sides of an issue in a fair man- ner, even if something disagrees with the author's perspective.
:::

## the Tyranny of the Present

::: incremental
-   Historians are creatures of the present, but can they free themselves from natural biases im- posed by their world view?

-   Must have a well-developed **empathy** for their subject.

-   **Presentism** emphasizes the difficulty in divorcing historical facts from current perspectives.
:::

## Is there a Pattern or direction in history?

::: incremental
-   Few hypotheses about the direction of history that are applicable to the history of psychology.

-   **Cyclical hypothesis** claims that history repeats itself. Cycles exist in every science, and psychology has seen its share.

-   For example, neuroscientists in the twentieth century wondered if the right and left hemispheres of the brain mediate different emotional and intellectual processes, or do the hemispheres function in a more integrated fashion? Interest in lateralization of function in the cerebral hemispheres is not new.
:::

## Linear progressive hypothesis

::: incremental
-   Each generation builds upon discoveries from previous generations.

-   Each new generation works up from a stronger base, giving rise to growth and progress in human knowledge and among human institutions.

-   The German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz was the best-known modern champion of progress theory.
:::

## Chaos hypothesis

::: incremental
-   It became clear that the entire structure of human achievement could be brought to ruin by a chance technological accident or by the design of political systems deficient in world perspective.

-   According to the **chaos hypothesis**, history itself has no overall identifiable and universal meaning.

-   For some, psychology is the product of a **chaotic history**. Koch argued that psychology's history is "a succession of changing doctrines about what to emulate in the natural sciences---especially physics".
:::

## What makes history?

::: incremental
-   We turn now to an issue of controversy among historians, one that holds special relevance for students of psychology.

-   The central question here asks whether history is fashioned through the bold actions of exceptional people or the "spirit of the times" in which they live. The **great-person theory** suggests that uncommon individuals tran- scend the conditions of their day and shape history through their courage or wisdom or some other virtue.

-   In contrast, the German terms **Zeitgeist** (spirit of a time) and **Ortgeist** (spirit of a place) argue that prevailing conditions, not individuals, forge historical events. The idea is that no person is greater than his or her time.

## Epistemology

The term epistemology is derived from the Greek *episteme*, which means *to understand* or *to know*. Epistemology is a branch of philosophy concerned with theories of knowledge.

::: incremental
-   A priori and a posteriori knowledge

-   Nativism versus Empiricism

-   Instinct versus Learning

-   Criteria by which we claim to know Truth?

-   The Role of Emotions in Knowledge

-   Science and Epistemology

-   Relevance of Epistemology to Psychology
:::

## A priori and a posteriori knowledge

::: incremental

- The philosophical term a priori comes from the Latin meaning “from what is prior” or “from what comes before.”
- a posteriori means “from what comes later.”
- Immanuel Kant (1724–1804), a posteriori refers to that which is derived from
or comes after experience and a priori refers to self-evident truths that come before experience.
- If A is larger than B and B is larger than C, then A is larger than C. The claim can be made that the truth of the proposition is known _a priori_.
- That is, without experience, we would not even know about the proposition.

:::

## Nativism vs. Empiricism

::: incremental

- _Nativism_ holds that some perceptions are operational from birth, built in as a natural outcome of the structural and functional properties of the nervous system.

- _Empiricism_ holds that all perceptions are learned or developed from experience.

:::

## Instinct versus Learning

::: incremental
- Many early psychologists stressed the role of instincts in human and animal psychology.
- _Behaviorists_ replaced instinct theories with an emphasis on learning. Behaviorism assumed that we learn to be aggressive, we learn to be inquisitive, and we learn to be good parents.
:::

## Criteria by which we claim to know Truth?

On what grounds can we claim to have knowledge?

::: incremental

- Authority: Reference to authority is the most common method of assessing truth. 
- During childhood, we incorporate the values, beliefs, and judgments of our parents. 
- _Man for Himself_, psychologist Erich Fromm (1900–1980) provided a
thoughtful analysis of the problem of authority: _the great sin in authoritarian epistemology is to become too much like the authority_.
- The history lots of examples of authoritarian abuse: for exampole: The 1978 mass suicide of over 900 Americans in Jonestown, Guyana (see Time, 1978), is a tragic example of abusive authoritarian control

:::

## Criteria by which we claim to know Truth?

Empiricism

::: incremental
- The term empiricism is derived from Greek and Latin terms that were close in meaning to our word experience.
- Knowledge is based on observable facts represented in experience.
- John Locke (1632–1704) argued that there is nothing in the intellect that was
not previously in the senses. 
- Francis Bacon (1561–1626) has been called the Great Herald of the Empirical Spirit because of his campaign to encourage observation and data collection.
- Problems: sensory information can be unreliable.
:::

## Criteria by which we claim to know Truth?

Rationalism

::: incremental
- The term rationalism comes from the same Latin root as the term reason.
- Rationalists argue that the mind has innate organizing principles so information from the senses is filtered and patterned in ways that are built into the organism. 
- Rationalists believe sensory information alone is not an adequate basis for knowledge.
- Early philosophers and scientists such as Descartes, Galileo, Leibniz, and Kant belonging to rationalism.
- 1732, Christian von Wolff wrote a book titled _Empirical Psychology_; two years later, he wrote a complementary book titled _Rational Psychology_.
:::

## Criteria by which we claim to know Truth?

Aestheticism

::: incremental
- Aestheticism is a doctrine that the principles of beauty apply to other arenas of thought.
- Aestheticism is an epistemology or way of knowing; for aestheticists, inquiry itself is a search for truth and beauty. This perspective is well illustrated in the book The Double Helix by Watson (1968).
- The aesthetic test has been of historical importance in the humanities—
especially in art and music.
:::

## Criteria by which we claim to know Truth?

Pragmatism

::: incremental
- The term _pragmatism_ is derived from a Greek root translated as pragma, which refers to “things accomplished” or “things done.”
- Francis Bacon believed we should emphasize theories and propositions that can be tested.
- Immanuel Kant used the term pragmatic to refer to that which is prudent. 
- Under the late nineteenth-century leadership of Charles Sanders Peirce (purse) and William James, pragmatism became a major philosophical movement.
- In typical American fashion, James talked about the “cash value” of an idea.
- Problem with pragmatism is that an idea or concept may appear sterile or unworkable in the present intellectual context, but may yield important truths at a later time. 
- The Copernican model of the solar system appeared unworkable at first, but later revolutionized our knowledge of astrophysics.
:::

## Criteria by which we claim to know Truth?

Scepticism

::: incremental
- All truth claims are suspect and must be questioned.
- Skepticism, as a method of discovering problems, can offer a potent source of progress and knowledge. 
- A society that discourages critical analysis and skepticism risks freezing the knowledge industry.
- In contrast, a society that encourages a skeptical ethic along with an evolutionary epistemology will be dynamic and open to the discovery mission
(Harrison, 2006).
