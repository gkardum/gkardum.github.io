## History of Psychology

The story of psychology begins in ancient times. 

--

As a self-conscious formal discipline, psychology is little more than a century old 

--

But the subject matter captured the human imagination long before psychology became a science.


---
## Lectures

Antiquity

--

Middle ages and the scholasticism

--

Modern age

--

Experimental age

--

Development of different schools of psychology
--

The world of variables - psychology meta-language

--

Clinical psychology and the deviations in the behaviour

---
## Roots of Psychology

- Roots of Psychology from the context of Philosophy: Greek Philosophy, Scholasticims, Renaissance, Enlightenment to Romanticism (... to the 1/2 of 19. century)
  
--

- Roots of Psychology in Physiology and Natural Science (19. and 20. century): Physiology roots, Psychophysics, Evolution

--

- Roots of major 20th Century Schools of Psychology

---
## Interesting, intriguing details of individual psychologists (Greenwood, )


Aristotle spent his honeymoon collecting biological specimens

--

Descartes’ skull, of Dr. “Monsterwork” and his lying machine

--

John B. Watson’s measurement of the female orgasm (the real reason he was fired from Johns Hopkins University).

--

Some of them deal with parapsychology or psychic experience/experiments: Jung, Ramiro Bujas 

---
## Why History of Psychology?

History as a Key to understanding the **Future** 

--

- History offers patterns that, when properly viewed, may prove consequential to our understanding and possible control of the present and the future. 

--

- Psychologists who appreciate their history may be in a better position to understand the discipline while anticipating future trends.)

---
## Why History of Psychology?

history as a Way to Enrich the **Present**

--

We live in a world of spatial, cultural, and temporal dimensions! That is present time...

--

Unfortunately, we can be just as narrow with respect to our time frame as we are with our knowledge of the physical world and other cultures.

--

Imagine how it would restrict your view of yourself if you only had memories about the last few years of your life.

---
## Why History of Psychology?

History as a Contribution to **Liberal Education**

--

Particularly given the increasing specialization in psychology, history can serve to provide context and a broader perspective within psychology (Benjamin &amp; Baker, 2009). 

--

Knowledge of the history of a discipline accentuates the understanding of influences, developments, and relations and contributes to a more informed and integrated perspective.

---
## Why History of Psychology?

History teaches **humility**

--

A perspective from past knowledge is larger and more informed than perspectives from the present alone.

--

History all too often reveals that our innovative idea is a rediscovery of something known long ago.

---
## Why History of Psychology?

History teaches a healthy **Skepticism**

--

When we have an understanding of history, we are less likely to fall prey to grandiose notions, utopian dreams, and schemes that promise more than they deliver. 

--

Psychology has suffered its share of counterfeit ideas, including mesmerism, phrenology, craniometry (the measurement of the skull to determine intelligence and personality), and even some modern therapies. 

---
## Why History of Psychology?

History influences human **thought processes**

Henle (1976) pointed out that most of us find it difficult to see our errors or question our assumptions. 

--

She argued that human cognition is often resistant to criticism and prone to a degree of **inertia** or **self preservation**. 

--

For her, knowledge of history “gives us distance not only from our immediate objective, but from our own thinking”

---
## Problems in historiography?

What makes history? 

--

Can history be objective?

--

Historiography has multiple meanings: it refers to the writing of history, including techniques and strategies for investigating specific content areas.

--

The term also encompasses philosophical questions about history and historical method

---
## Historical consciousness

Gilderhus (1992) suggests that primitive peoples often lacked historical consciousness because immediate survival was their primary concern. 

--

Survival depends on memory along with an awareness of time-based events. This temporal awareness has survival value and contributes to the development of historical consciousness. 

--

Knowledge of the historical significance of events benefits both individuals and society.

--

Historical consciousness grows from the belief that important events carry real significance in the pursuit of religion, politics, or science (Jesus Christ, Holocaust, 9/11 twins...)

## Discipline methods


---
## Critical issues in historical studies (King, Viney, Woody, 2016)

Why study history?

--

- History as a Key to Understanding the Future

--

- History as a Way to Enrich the Present

--

- History as a Contribution to Liberal Education

--

- History Teaches Humility

--

- History Teaches a Healthy Skepticism

--

- History Influences Human Thought Processes

---
## Some problems in historiography

- The Development of Historical Consciousness

--

- What Is History?

--

- Can History Be Objective?

--

- The Tyranny of the Present

-- 

- Is There a Pattern or Direction in History?

--

- What Makes History?

--

- The New History or the Old?

--

- What Is the History of Psychology, the History Of?

---
## Can history be objective?

People have a kind of commonsense faith that historical research whether it deals with religious, political, scientific, or social topics is an **accurate reflection** of the landscape of the past. 

--

Historians do not usually make direct observations. 

--

The question of objectivity is a critical issue in the philosophy of history. 

--

Meaning of objectivity involves the attempt to portray all sides of an issue in a fair man- ner, even if something disagrees with the author’s perspective. 

---
## the Tyranny of the Present


Historians are creatures of the present, but can they free themselves from natural biases im- posed by their world view?

--

Must have a well-developed **empathy** for their subject.

--

**Presentism** emphasizes the difficulty in divorcing historical facts from current perspectives.

--

---
## Is there a Pattern or direction in history?

Few hypotheses about the direction of history that are applicable to the history of psychology.

--

**Cyclical hypothesis** claims that history repeats itself. Cycles exist in every science, and psychology has seen its share. 

--

For example, neuroscientists in the twentieth century wondered if the right and left hemispheres of the brain mediate different emotional and intellectual processes, or do the hemispheres function in a more integrated fashion? Interest in lateralization of function in the cerebral hemispheres is not new.

---
## Linear progressive hypothesis

Each generation builds upon discoveries from previous generations. 

--

Each new generation works up from a stronger base, giving rise to growth and progress in human knowledge and among human institutions.

--

The German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz was the best-known modern champion of progress theory. 

---
## Chaos hypothesis

It became clear that the entire structure of human achievement could be brought to ruin by a chance technological accident or by the design of political systems deficient in world perspective.

--

According to the **chaos hypothesis**, history itself has no overall identifiable and universal meaning.

--

For some, psychology is the product of a **chaotic history**. Koch argued that psychology’s history is “a succession of changing doctrines about what to emulate in the natural sciences—especially physics".

---
## What makes history?

We turn now to an issue of controversy among historians, one that holds special relevance for students of psychology. 

--

The central question here asks whether history is fashioned through the bold actions of exceptional people or the “spirit of the times” in which they live. The **great-person theory** suggests that uncommon individuals tran- scend the conditions of their day and shape history through their courage or wisdom or some other virtue. 

--

In contrast, the German terms **Zeitgeist** (spirit of a time) and **Ortgeist** (spirit of a place) argue that prevailing conditions, not individuals, forge historical events. The idea is that no person is greater than his or her time.



---
## Philosophical issues

Epistemology

The term epistemology is derived from the Greek episteme, which means to understand or to know.

--

- A priori and a priori knowledge

--

- Nativism versus Empiricism

--

- Instinct versus Learning

--

- The Role of Emotions in Knowledge

--

- Science and Epistemology

--

- Relevance of Epistemology to Psychology
